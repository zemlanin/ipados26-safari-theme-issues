This repo demonstates issues with `<meta name="theme-color">` in Safari on iPadOS 26\* Developer Beta 1, namely:

- `<meta name="theme-color">` does not affect Safari top bar
- `<meta name="theme-color">` does not affect the viewport "background" color when overscrolling

\* â€” macOS 26 Tahoe seems to also have these issues, but I don't have a device to confirm that for myself
